Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

SOLUTION

with nums as 
(
    select num as num1,
    lead(num, 1) over() num2,
    lead(num,2) over() num3
    from Logs
)
select distinct num1 as ConsecutiveNums
from nums
where nums.num1 = nums.num2
and nums.num2 = nums.num3
